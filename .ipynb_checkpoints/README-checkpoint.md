# Risk Analysis: Venture Funding
The aim of this project is to predict the success of a startup if funded by Alphabet Soup, a fictitious venture capital firm. The goal is train and evaluate a deep learning model that uses the provided features to create a binary classifier to predict the success of an applicant. 

## About
Venture capital firms are known to fund small businesses and startups. There are many applicants that have received funding from Alphabet Soup, but not all were successful in their startups. Risk management is a crucial part of the success of the venture capital firm. That is, being able to predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup is key to the success of Alphabet Soup. By using historical records of previously funded organizations, machine learning and neural networks models will be built using the Sequential classifier in the TensorFlow Python package. Various features of the model will be tweaked to best optimize the model for predictions.

## Getting Started
To run the Jupyter notebook and interact with the visualizations, you need to have the following software and Python libraries installed:

- Python 3.10 or later
- Anaconda Distribution
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- Keras

## Installing
1. Install the latest verion of Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Install the latest version of Anaconda [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download).

3. Installing Anaconda includes the Pandas package.

4. To install the scikit-learn and TensorFlow packages, run the following command in your terminal.

```
pip install -U scikit-learn
pip install --upgrade tensorflow
```
5. Installing TensorFlow includes the Keras package.

## Usage
You can clone or download this GitHub project and open the `venture_funding_with_deep_learning.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook. The Jupyter Notebook is seperated into sections that cover different aspects of the analysis. Each section contains explanations and code snippets.
